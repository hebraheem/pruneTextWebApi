Front End JavaScript Challenge
This exercise is to help you practice the topics you’ve learnt so far.
- Your assignment would require you to create a simple web app with data using the API given 
to you. 
- It should have a simple landing page that would display all the news (paginated) as a list with 
only title and description
- There should be `next` and `back` links at the bottom of the page
- Clicking on any of the news would display a single news below with the title, description, 
author, image and content.
API: 
https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=bitcoin&apiKey=bc6dde98f0564ae8885cde0960b424f3&
page=1
Documentation: https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
Notes:
1. The styling/aesthetics of the application is insignificant for this exercise.
2. Create a repository for this project on your personal GitHub and push solution to it. I’d 
like to see how you use git (particularly how you save changes with git commits).
3. Always remember to reach out for help when you are blocked. Also ask before 
implementing if any instruction is unclear.
